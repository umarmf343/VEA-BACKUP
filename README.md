### Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 8.x or higher

#### Local Development
\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd vea-2025-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

#### Production Deployment
\`\`\`bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`

### Environment Variables

Runtime configuration is validated on startup by [`lib/env.ts`](./lib/env.ts). The server will throw a descriptive error if any mandatory value is missing so configuration issues surface immediately. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (or the appropriate environment file) and replace the placeholders with real secrets:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | ✅ | Node environment (`development`, `test`, or `production`). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Connection string for the primary database. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Secret used to sign and verify authentication tokens. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | ✅ | Key material for AES-256-GCM encryption helpers. |
| `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ | Server-side Paystack secret key for API calls. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY` | ✅ | Client-side Paystack public key exposed to the browser. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | ✅ | Fully qualified base URL of the deployed app (used in callbacks). |
| `REPORT_CARD_DATA_DIR` | ➖ | Optional path override for report-card JSON storage. |
| `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` | ➖ | Set to `true` only for local prototyping to bypass validation. |

> ℹ️ **Tip:** Keep `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` unset (or `false`) in all automated environments so CI/CD fails fast when configuration drifts.
